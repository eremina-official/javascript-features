    <h1>Object-oriented Programming Principles</h1>

    <p>Principles of Object-oriented Programming:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Abstraction</strong> - is a process of presenting only relevant features of an object and hiding the features which are less important. F.e. if an object represents a real world item, this object describes only certain features of this item and ignores features that are currently not important. Abstraction helps to reduce complexity.</li>

      <li><strong>Encapsulation</strong> - is an idea of hiding object's properties and methods inside the object so that they could not be modified from outside. </li>

      <li><strong>Inheritance</strong> - is an idea that objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.</li>

      <li><strong>Polymorphism</strong> - is an idea that methods can have the same name but different implementations.</li>
    </ul>
