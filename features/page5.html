    <h1>Strict mode</h1>
  
    <p>What strict mode does:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>changes some <strong>silent JavaScript errors into throw errors</strong>: f.e. in the strict mode it is not possible to accidentaly create a new global variable by mistyping in an assignment, create properties with same keys on one object, assign to non-writable property or delete undelitable property.</li>
      <li><strong>fixes mistakes</strong> that make it difficult for JS engines to perform optimisations.</li>
      <li>prohibits some <strong>syntax</strong> which is likely to be used in future versions of ECMAscript (f.e. adds reserved words like let etc).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>'use strict' statement applies for entire scripts or for individual functions, it does not apply for block statements. For the 'use strict' statements to work for the entire stript it should be placed at the very top of the js file.</p>

    <p>Practical part: test for strict mode. Open console to view results.</p>
