    <h1>this</h1>

    <p><code>this</code> is a function's keyword, a reference to a JavaScript <strong>contex object</strong> in which the current code is executing.</p>

    <p>In usual <strong>functions</strong> value of <code>this</code> does not depend on where a function is lexically declared. Value of <code>this</code> is defined at a runtime depending on how the function is called.</p>

    <p><strong>Default binding</strong> of <code>this</code> in a plain function call: <code>this</code> is the global object (or undefined in the strict mode).</p>

    <p>When function is called as an <strong>object's method</strong>: <code>this</code> is set to the object.</p>

    <p>If the object's method is assigned to a new variable, and that variable is used as a reference to call the method, the value of <code>this</code> is set like if the function was called with the default binding (<code>this</code> will be global object or undefined).</p>

    <p>In <strong>arrow functions</strong> <code>this</code> is bound lexically, that means in arrow function the value of <code>this</code> is set and bound to the enclosing lexical environment (means where the function is physically written).</p>
